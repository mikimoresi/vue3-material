# vue3-material
A collection of vue material components (https://github.com/vuematerial/vue-material) converted to vue3

This is a collection of components derived from vue material ( a material library stuck at vue2 ) converted to vue3, I wanted to embed them directly in my project so i did not use the common library npm pattern. If you want to collaborate converting it to be a standard NPM package I will be very glad to approve you PRs.

All you need to do is to copy the folder and add it into your project then require components as you would normally do with your custom components. Check this project's package.json to see which dependencies you need to add to your project in order to have these components working.

If you see App.vue there are examples of how to use buttons, tooltips etc...
